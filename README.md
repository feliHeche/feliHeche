## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal GitHub profile! My name is FÃ©licien HÃªche and I recently completed a **PhD in Machine Learning** at the **Haute Ã‰cole d'IngÃ©nierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud (HEIG-VD)** in Switzerland. I am passionate about developing innovative machine learning algorithms to tackle complex real-world problems.  

## ðŸ§  Interests
My research focuses on cutting-edge techniques in machine learning and their applications to solve real-world problems. Here are my main areas of interest:  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Offline RL and decision-making under uncertainty.  
- **Deep Learning**: Advanced neural network architectures and optimization.  
- **Machine Learning**: Data-driven modeling and predictive analytics.  
- **Statistics**: Theoretical and applied statistical methods.  


## ðŸš€ Published works
Here are my current published work:
- **[Offline reinforcement learning in high-dimensional stochastic environments](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-023-09029-3)**
- **[Inhomogeneous Poisson Process for Ambulance Relocation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3615895.3628172)**
- **[Inhomogeneous Poisson Process for Ambulance Dispatch](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10628846)**
